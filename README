Statistics-MVA-MultipleRegression version 0.0.1

    The general purpose of multiple regression is to gain information about the relationship between several independent
    variables (x_i) and a dependent variable (y). The procedure involves fitting an equation of the form:
    
        y = b_o + x_1 * b_1 + x_2 * b_2 +... ... x_n * b_n

    This is a minimal implementation of least squares procedure that accepts a List-of-Lists in which each nested list
    corresponds to a single set of observations. The single exported routine returns the coefficients (b_i) and R^2.
